# UEnquire: A Chatbot Inquiry Utilizing Twitter with Naive Bayes
A web-base application, built to assist the inquiry system of the university of the east.
The model from which the chatbot is geared from also has an adaptive 
capability. With the use of Deep Learning techniques, the chatbot is developed 
using words and patterns as the intents of the users in which serves as its training 
material. Using a classification algorithm as an aide for data analysis, the admin 
can operate the system from behind the scene.Use his/her authorization to adapt 
or evolve the current model according to the result of the systemâ€™s built-in data 
analytics. Twitter is also a major factor that contributes to the growth of the system, 
by giving the system the ability to collect and store data from UE related Twitter 
accounts. The admin may use this data and classify them accordingly using an 
algorithm. The classified data can be interpreted and used by the admin to further 
improve the functionality of the chatbot.
